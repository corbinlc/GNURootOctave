# GNURootOctave

This can be built using any version of Android Studio that supports experimental gradle build 0.7.3
and the Android NDK.

GNURoot Octave relies on [GNURootDebian](https://github.com/corbinlc/GNURootDebian) to run. See its
README for instructions to build a launcher of your own!
